servicesTitle0: Pre Made
servicesDescription0: I love to learn new techniques all the time, which results
  in me creating an assortment of knitted and crocheted items throughout the
  year. Sometimes I have a recipient in mind for them but a lot of the time I
  find certain patterns or ideas irresistible and can't help but create them -
  regardless of what materials I have to hand! I tend to make one offs to make
  every creation unique but occasionally I will bulk make certain items for
  seasonal events. If you're looking to buy one of my pre- made items please
  have a look through my Etsy shop to see what is currently available.
servicesTitle1: Custom Made
servicesDescription1: As well as items I make generally, I love creating that
  special something for a special someone. So, if you would like something from
  my portfolio (see creations below), either as it is shown or customised in any
  way, or even something completely different please get in touch through the
  contact form at the bottom of the page. Whether you already have a pattern, an
  image to work from or only just an idea of what you are after, I would love to
  work with you to see that creation come to life. Prices of a custom make will
  depend on the type of wool used and time needed to create it.
servicesTitle2: Patterns
servicesDescription2: After following various patterns over the years and either
  occasionally altering them to suit my needs or not being able to find exactly
  what I was after, I started to create my own patterns. Links or credits to all
  the patterns I have followed from others are detailed in the individual item
  pages (see creations below), and all of my own patterns are available to buy
  on my Etsy shop (linked towards the bottom of the page).
servicesTitle3: Tutorials
servicesDescription3: "From learning only the basics from a young age and not
  picking my needles and hooks back up a few years ago, I am still learning
  every day and discovering my own preferred way of doing things. Here, I will
  share some of the most useful things I have picked up and a couple of tips and
  how - tos. If there's anything in particular you would like to know but I've
  not got anything listed about it, please feel free to get in touch via the
  contact form at the bottom of the page. "
