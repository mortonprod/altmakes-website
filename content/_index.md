servicesTitle0: Pre Made
servicesDescription0: <b>I love<b> to learn new techniques all the time, which
  results in me creating an assortment of knitted and crocheted items throughout
  the year. Sometimes I will have a recipient in mind for them but a lot of the
  time I find certain patterns or ideas irresistible! I tend to make one offs to
  make every creation unique but occasionally I will bulk make certain items for
  seasonal events. If you're looking to buy one of my pre- made items please
  have a look through my Etsy shop to see what is currently available.
servicesTitle1: Custom Made
servicesDescription1: As well as items I make generally, I love creating that
  special something for a special someone. So, if you would like something from
  my portfolio (see creations below), either as it is shown or would like it
  customised, or would like something completely different please get in touch
  through the contact form at the bottom of the page. I would love to work with
  you to see that creation come to life. Prices of a custom make will depend on
  the size of the item, type of wool used and time needed to create it.
servicesTitle2: Patterns
servicesDescription2: After following various patterns over the years and either
  occasionally altering them to suit my needs or not being able to find exactly
  what I was after, I started to create my own patterns. Links or credits to all
  the patterns I have followed from others are detailed in the individual pages
  below, and all of my own patterns are available to buy on my Etsy shop.
servicesTitle3: Tutorials
servicesDescription3: "From learning only the basics from a young age and not
  picking my needles back up fairly recently I am still learning every day and
  discovering my own preferred way of doing things. "
