meTitle: Hello! I'm Anna Louise Turner and welcome to my website of woolen
  creations.   Since leaving my job earlier in the year I found myself focusing
  more and more on my crochet and knitting (as well as planning for travel
  across Europe, when such luxuries are allowed again) and decided to lean into
  my refounded passion.  I grew up in the north west of England, where my great
  auntie taught me the basics of knitting and crocheting, either when she would
  come to visit or we visited her in Glasgow. I later moving to Glasgow to do my
  degree in Earth Science and stayed on working (until recently) as a
  Geotechnical and Environmental engineer. It wasn't until a few years ago, and
  after inheriting my great auntie's needles and hooks A few of my favourite
  things include family and friends, the great outdoors, geology, music and
  gigging, food (specifically all things potato), sudoku, fluffy socks, gin and,
  of course, crochet and knitting.

servicesTitle0: Pre Made
servicesDescription0: I love to learn new techniques all the time, which results
  in me creating an assortment of knitted and crocheted items throughout the
  year. Sometimes I will have a recipient in mind for them but a lot of the time
  I find certain patterns or ideas irresistible! I tend to make one offs to make
  every creation unique but occasionally I will bulk make certain items for
  seasonal events. If you're looking to buy one of my pre- made items please
  have a look through my Etsy shop to see what is currently available.
servicesTitle1: Custom Made
servicesDescription1: As well as items I make generally, I love creating that
  special something for a special someone. So, if you would like something from
  my portfolio (see creations below), either as it is shown or customised in any
  way, or even something completely different please get in touch through the
  contact form at the bottom of the page. Whether you already have a pattern, an
  image to work from or only just an idea of what you are after, I would love to
  work with you to see that creation come to life. Prices of a custom make will
  depend on the type of wool used and time needed to create it.
servicesTitle2: Patterns
servicesDescription2: After following various patterns over the years and either
  occasionally altering them to suit my needs or not being able to find exactly
  what I was after, I started to create my own patterns. Links or credits to all
  the patterns I have followed from others are detailed in the individual pages
  below, and all of my own patterns are available to buy on my Etsy shop.
servicesTitle3: Tutorials
servicesDescription3: "From learning only the basics from a young age and not
  picking my needles and hooks back up until fairly recently, I am still
  learning every day and discovering my own preferred way of doing things. Here,
  I will share some of the most useful things I have picked up and a couple of
  tips and how - tos. If there's anything in particular you would like to know
  but I've not got anything listed about it, please feel free to get in touch
  via the contact form at the bottom of the page. "
