servicesDescription0: "I love to learn new techniques all the time, which
  results in me creating an assortment of knitted and crocheted items throughout
  the year. Sometimes I will have a recipient in mind for them but a lot of the
  time it is simply because the pattern called to me and just needed to be made.
  I try to make one offs to make every creation unique but occasionally I will
  bulk make certain items for seasonal events. If you're looking to buy one of
  my pre- made items please have a look through my Etsy shop. "

servicesDescription2: "After following various patterns over the years I
  occasionally found myself altering some of them to better suit my needs or
  equipment, or looking for the right design and not being able to find them.
  Some of my slightly altered patterns I will write up in blog posts on the
  website, while the patterns made from scratch can be found on my Etsy shop. "
