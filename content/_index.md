servicesDescription0: "I love to learn new techniques all the time, which
  results in me creating an assortment of knitted and crocheted items throughout
  the year. Sometimes I will have a recipient in mind for them but a lot of the
  time it is simply because the pattern called to me and just needed to be made.
  I try to make one offs to make every creation unique but occasionally I will
  bulk make certain items for seasonal events. If you're looking to buy one of
  my pre- made items please have a look through my Etsy shop to see what is
  currently on offer.. "

servicesDescription2: After following various patterns over the years and either
  occasionally altering them to suit my needs or not being able to find exactly
  what I was after, I started to create my own patterns. Links or credits to all
  the patterns I have followed from others are detailed in the individual pages
  below, and all of my own patterns are available to buy on my Etsy shop.
