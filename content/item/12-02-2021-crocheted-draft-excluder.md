title: Crocheted Draft Excluder

summary: Cosy crochet
description: "One of my first free hand creations was born from the arrival of
  two things: a bitterly cold Scottish winter and a bumper pack of multicoloured
  wool. Having just received my rainbow delivery and curious as to what they
  looked like when in use, I grabbed the only hook I owned at the time (4mm) and
  got to work on a draft excluder which would put Joseph’s Technicolour Dream
  Coat to shame. As I went I tried to incorporate every different colour in the
  bumper pack (some were duplicates which is always a possibility when buying
  bumper packs) as well as randomising both colour and width of each block;
  which is a lot harder than you might imagine."
detail: >-
  T﻿he pattern for my draft excluder is written in US crochet terms. Yes I'm
  from the UK but they are what I learnt first and personally, it's how my brain
  default reads any pattern. I will create a page to define the difference and
  provide the link later. In the mean time, when you see single crochet that's a
  UK double. 


  I﻿ like to place my stitch marker in my first stitch because I find identifying the first stitch from a magic circle to be tricky sometimes but I know some who like to place it in their last. Each work just the same as long as you are consistent and remember if it's marking the start or the end of your round. So feel free to place it where you wish.
