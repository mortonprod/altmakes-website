title: Crocheted Draft Excluder test

summary: This is a draft excluder
description: "One of my first free hand creations was born from the arrival of
  two things: a bitterly cold Scottish winter and a bumper pack of multicoloured
  wool. Having just received my rainbow delivery and curious as to what they
  looked like when in use, I grabbed the only hook I owned at the time (4mm) and
  got to work on a draft excluder which would put Josephâ€™s Technicolour Dream
  Coat to shame. As I went I tried to incorporate every different colour in the
  bumper pack (some were duplicates which is always a possibility when buying
  bumper packs) as well as randomising both colour and width of each block;
  which is a lot harder than you might imagine."
