summary: Rawwr-some project for dinosaur lovers.
description: >-
  When my fellow geologist friend announced she was pregnant with her first baby
  back in 2017, my woolen brain knew exactly what to make... an amigurumi
  Dinosaur! The hunt was on to find the cutest pattern I could find. After hours
  of searching and seeing so many beautiful patterns, I finally settled on this
  adorable T-Rex by Kristel - Available as a free download from:
  <https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/t-rex-amigurumi>.


  With being fairly new to crocheting at the time I only had the old school metal hooks I inherited from my Great Aunt and I found these didn't fit very comfortably in my large hands. So, off I skipped to [Hobbycraft](https://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/) (a place I need no excuse to visit) to buy a new 4mm hook and some baby friendly wool. 


  Having got half way through the head, I was at a loss as to why my work wasn't looking anything like pictures. After a slight stress I decided to go back to my faithful teacher - YouTube - and figure out where I was going wrong. It was at this moment I realised the UK and the US refer to the same stitches as different things, and to make things more confusing the names are the same but just off by one \*Deep Breaths\*. Turns out I, being situated in the UK, had been watching US videos and had learnt all their terminology (which is also why my patterns tend to be US terms. Personally they make more sense and I find it difficult to unlearn now).


  The pain was real having to unravel what I had just spent ages making but attempt no.2 and ***Hallelujah***, it worked! Now on a roll I finished the head and remaining individual items over the following months and was ready to sew my adorable T-Rex together.... Ah, another stumbling block. Sewing - Possibly my least favourite part (so much so I will purposefully pick all in one patterns if I can). After a number of attempts to sew the head to the body, and failing terribly, I am ashamed to say my dinosaur went back into a bag, unsewn, and I missed the birth of the recipient. 


  Over the following years, little by little, and in between other projects, I sewed together the head, body, legs and one foot. For reasons I can't remember this is where the dinosaur stayed until Lockdown no.1 2020 and made a promise with myself that I was to finish off all part done projects before starting any new ones. Finally, after almost 3 full years the T-Rex was whole and ready to be gifted! I am pleased to say the T-Rex was well received and at an age where her love for dinosaurs was coming in to full swing (which was, of course, the plan all along!!)
