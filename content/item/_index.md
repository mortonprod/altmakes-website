  **One of my first free hand creations was born from the arrival of two things:
  a bitterly cold Scottish winter and a bumper pack of multicoloured wool.
  Having just received my rainbow delivery and curious as to what they looked
  like when in use, I grabbed the only hook I owned at the time (4mm) and got to
  work on a draft excluder which would put Josephâ€™s Technicolour Dream Coat to
  shame. As I went I tried to incorporate every different colour in the bumper
  pack (some were duplicates which is always a possibility when buying bumper
  packs) as well as randomising both colour and width of each block; which is a
  lot harder than you might imagine.**




  **I'm currently in the process of writing up the pattern for this so bear with me while I get this finished and uploaded onto Etsy.**
